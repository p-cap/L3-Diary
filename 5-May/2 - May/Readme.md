# Sorry for the missing entries for a couple of days but....here's what I accomplished so far
- I created a repo ```https://github.com/p-cap/dev4CTF.git``` for the purpose of me sovling two crypto challenges during the Cyber Apocolypse CTF. I shared my code to my teammates
- Also, I created a repo ```https://github.com/p-cap/vul-app-one.git``` to have somebody to pentest the vulnerable application and hopefully, come up with a write-up
- And, of course, I had a week of CTF stuff
- I will try to pick up the pace but shifting to a different focus.....threat hunting and CTI stuff
