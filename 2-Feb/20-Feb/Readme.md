## Not successful in refactoring my SQL injection project

it worked......sort of wokred but:
- When I decided to have an optional render on my view that returns the username and password, it would create numerous amounts HTTP requests
- I had issues with CORS in which I had to download the CORS extension for chrome.
- I utilized the input fields that I designed but it was not serving the purpose of my project. It was basically acting as a required field.


# I have decided to revert back to the MVP of my code. And if time permits, I will then try to refactor my code once again.

### What did I learn? 
- I was able to return data from an axios request
- I've gotten better with parent to child props
- I think I kinda understand useEffect
- I kinda know how to have a parent form html element with input as child elements in order to submit values from the inputs with onChange event handling
