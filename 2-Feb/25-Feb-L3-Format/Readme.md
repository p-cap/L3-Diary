# L3 Format to learn faster

The new L3 format will allow me to learn faster and retain info longer. 

NOTE:
- "True mastery is to foucu more on the OUTPUT than the input"
- 1X input = 2x output
- "Use it or lose it"

## Potential format 
- Learn => 100% attention
- Reflect => take away / how to use the info
- Implement => schedule a way to action on the content
- share = self talk

# SUPERCHARGE YOUR BRAIN
- Belief that you can remember stuff
- Full attention to what you are learning
- Association
- Review = for example, read content for an hour, then schedule a 5 min review on the content

## Format for the upcoming L3 
- Preparation => what am I gonna learn the next day 
- Decomposiion => based on the lesson for the next day, how would you subdivide the content
- Schedule your learning => how long will I read the content
- Review time => review what I just read or did
- Implement => I create my own tasks to enforce my understanding
- Crazy talk => talk to yourself to identify what you learned

# SAMPLE L3 Annotatition
- Prep: Advanced IOS Volume 1 - Happy Days - pg 30 - ?
- Decompose: after an hour, perform decomposition inside the code and identify what I do not understand and apply what I just learned. Also, I can try  
  to find a stopping even without reaching an hour to reinforce what I learned
- Schedule: For now, we'll do every hour. I will get to it after the house is inspected
- Review: My decomposition will serve as my review
- Implement: maybe......create sub projects to reinforce my learning
- Crazy talk: before I sleep, practice in trying to recall what I've done 

### Decomposition tasks
- I FELL ASLEEP
